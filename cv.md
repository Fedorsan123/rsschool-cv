### _About Me_

I'm 17 years old and I aspire to become a FullStack developer. I’ve been studying everything related to web-development for a year now. I’ve written several websites for myself.I also passed an interview at KATA ACADEMY, wrote a calculator and conducted an interview, but I was not accepted due to my age. And now, in parallel with the course, I’m participating in a team project, in which my team and I are creating a website based on the Witcher universe.

### _Skills_
| Programming languages |Markup language and others|
| :-----------: | :-----------: |
| JS (basic lvl)     |HTML5|
| Phyton (basic lvl)     |CSS3|
| TypeScript (basic lvl)     |Adaptive layout|


### _Example_
##### "Abundant Numbers"

---

```JS
let arr = [];
    let AbundArr =[];
    for (let i = 0; i<=n; i++){     
    let sum = 0;
        for (let j=0; j<i; j++){
            if(i % j===0){
                sum=sum+j;
            }
      } 
    if(sum>i){
        AbundArr.push(i,sum);
    }
  }
  let a = AbundArr.at(-2);
  let b = AbundArr.at(-1);
  let res = [a,b-a];
  return res; 
} Abundant(19); 
```

This is my solution to the "Abundant Numbers" problem from 6kyu, although I don’t understand why they need to display numbers in the format [[a],[b]], and not just [a,b], well, never mind
 
### _Experience_
 I haven’t had any work experience yet, so I have nothing to brag about 

### _Education_
```/
1)Maximum Education - website building (3 month)
2)Layout marathons
3)Udemy.com - Web development - from scratch to professional. Full Stack(not completely)
4)Udemy.com - Intensive immersion in JS
```
### _English_

Intermediate - I understand speech and texts well, but it can be difficult for me to say something on my own.
